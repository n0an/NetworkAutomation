â€‹#Difflib Short Guide


There are mainly 4 cases which we should address in the code (if/elif block):


1. A command exists in the old file version (yesterday), but doesn't exist in the new one (today) -> the line starts with "-" in diff_file and the next line does NOT start with "?" or "+".

Example:

Was in old version, not there anymore: 

- version 10.2R3.999;


2. A command does NOT exist in the old file version (yesterday), but exists in the new one (today) -> the line starts with "+" in diff_file and the next line does NOT start with "?".

Example:

Was not in old version, is there now:

...

  interface Loopback105

   ip address 100.100.100.105 255.255.255.255

+  duplex full

  interface Loopback106

...


3. A command has been changed between versions, having more characters in the new version -> the line starts with "-" in diff_file and the next two lines start with "+" and "?", respectively.

Example:

Change detected here:

-                 192.168.1.;

+                 192.168.1.1;

?                           +


4. A command has been changed between versions, having equal or less characters in the new version -> the line starts with "-" in diff_file and the next three lines start with "?", "+" and "?", respectively.

Examples:

Change detected here:

-  ip address 100.100.100.100 255.255.255.255

?                          ^^

+  ip address 100.100.100.199 255.255.255.255

?        

or:

Change detected here:

-                 192.168.1.22;

?                           ^^

+                 192.168.1.1;

?                           ^
